u/Jimbobsausage,For people who interview potential candidates for high level positions what was the worst interview you conducted?,"The weirdest and most unique one we ever had didn't become apparent until AFTER the interview a week or so later when it turned out he was from a competitor.  To elaborate: we were interviewing for a replacement engineering leadership position since one of our leads was retiring. It was likely going to go to an internal candidate but we were investigating all possibilities outside as well. One of the external applicants that was at the top of the list gave off a very odd vibe during the initial in-person discussion. He answered the questions at a pretty generic level and wasn't very knowledgeable, but he was extremely nosey and aggressive with requesting details around what exactly he'd be doing, which tech he'd be working with, how we went about or designs, etc. There were no glaring red flags other than he wasn't qualified, but it was a very weird interview all around and afterwards we couldn't help but feel like WE were getting interviewed and prodded. The guy was really high on himself.  A week or so later some of the C Suite people randomly hear that our company name is getting trash talked a lot to our clients by a competitor. A good deal of people at high levels in the business space know each other and word got around that someone was saying that they had very detailed knowledge of how we operate and how behind the times we were. They were essentially trying to up sell themselves as the better choice and reaching out to our clients to pull them away with this ""confidential info"".  Turns out that the guy we interviewed was a high level sales guy from a competitor and he thought by faking an interview with us as someone else he could get some sort of insider knowledge that would give him an edge up and allow him to steal our customers. Our leadership just happened to have contacts with his leadership and the guy was let go almost immediately. Big brain move.  The thing is, there was nothing particularly special about the info discussed in our interview. Routine procedures, software, and info that most companies in the space use. Yeah it was a bit more detailed because of his prodding, but no corporate secretes or anything particularly sensitive.  The dude thought somehow he was committing corporate espionage and spying on us because of a freaking interview and ended up getting his ass fired. So clever! :D","I once set up an interview with someone for a lead position at a company I’ve since left. Right from the start, they sent me a snarky email saying, “If you’re going to post a job, at least make sure the people you mention actually work there.” I was confused, so I asked them to clarify. They responded, claiming the name of the company’s founder/director listed in the ad wasn’t accurate and that no one went by that name in the list of employees on the website.  Confused, I double-checked our website and right at the very top of our “Meet the team page” has the name and photo of the company director, which matched the name listed in the ad.  I therefore went back to the candidate and confirmed that the name of the director on the job ad was indeed correct and apologised if they misread this. They responded, completely unacknowleding my response, to confirm their interview time.   Weird, but ok.   Fast forward a few days to the interviews and we are conducting the initial rounds via Zoom. The candidate from the email tried to join the meeting 45 minutes before their scheduled time while I was interviewing another candidate, so I declined their request to enter, and intended on giving them a call once finished to see if something happened/they needed to meet earlier. Before the other interview even ended, I received a rambling email where they berated me for not letting them in early and threatened to report me to [company directors name]  I simply replied, “We don’t have anyone by that name working here,” and then blocked them."
u/NumanLover,What masterpiece film do you actually not like nor understand why others do?,Elaine was right. The English Patient,"Most people seem to think Breakfast at Tiffany's is a wonderful picture.  Even disregarding the Mickey Rooney silliness, I just find it mediocre."
u/Western_Definition80,What’s a Life Hack That Sounds Fake but Is Actually Legit?,Taking a big whiff of something astringent - like an alcohol wipe or lemon juice - can get rid of nausea.   The first time someone suggested smelling rubbing alcohol to me I thought they were insane but it got rid of my nausea almost instantly.,"If you're trying to see something in the dark, look next to it instead of directly at it."
u/PhenomenalPancake,What's an argument you couldn't believe you had to have with an adult?,"I met someone who didn’t believe in space. Not space travel, outer space. Just didn’t think it was real.",I once had to explain that going 60 miles per hour meant you would literally travel 60 miles in an hour to a colleague. We were both in our mid 20s at the time. I don’t know how they passed math class ever.
