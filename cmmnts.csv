u/suspiciouskind,"People who married your partner despite having an unsatisfactory sex life, how are you doing?","Me and my wife had differing drives. We lasted 7 years. The lack of sex wasn't a deal breaker. The lack of any intimacy, including hugs or kisses, was.","Don’t know if you’ll see this op but my wife and I had a poor sex life for the first eight years we dated before marriage and like over a decade after we got married. She was sexually abused as a child, which led to complications of intimacy. I was never satisfied and learned to hide my sexual desire from her so as not to trigger her. It was incredibly lonely and difficult. But, we kept at it and now, after all these years, the sex I dreamed we’d have as teenagers, we’re having in late middle age, now that we have a 9 year old son. There were times when it could have fallen apart, but we kept at it and kept working on ourselves. Or values are really similar and she lets me be myself as I do with her.   I see a lot of doom ITT and I felt that doom in my marriage at times, but I also felt her fierce love of me and mine of her. I always saw what our sex could be and that promise was not false.  Just a different experience than many have had."
u/PizzaBliAnanas,"People who left their religion, what was the final straw that made you leave?",Asking me for a paystub to verify I was actually tithing 10%. Pastor was driving a new Cadillac. Gtfo,"tbh, I left when I noticed that my ‘community’ felt more like a ‘judgmental audience’!"
u/MabelMist,What’s the wildest thing you’ve accidentally overheard during someone else’s ‘private time’?,I was getting moderately drunk in my backyard when my neighbor started yelling so damn loud that I could hear them from inside their house. Mom was telling dad that she was sick of their disabled son jacking off in their car.,"Two old ladies on a bus in Aberdare.  ""I told her she's being too bloody fussy. A cock's a cock"""
u/GreedyHog2Fuk,What's keeping y'all single right now?,"# I DON'T KNOW, MOM! GEEZ!","Gotta unfat myself and kick my addictions. I'm not the ""me"" I want to put out there yet.  Edit: Thanks for the positivity fam. I appreciate you all. And for those who care or are going through it as well know I'm not just talking, I'm doing. I'm down 30 lbs this year so far and I've quit drinking and quit smoking weed. Still got another 30 or so lbs to shed and I still need to kick cigarettes and porn. It's doable friends. My brain is producing endorphins on its own (not substance induced) for what seems like the first time in YEARS, my social anxiety has decreased considerably and I can see the sun on the horizon :)"
